Data analysis and visualisation final project, University of Warsaw 2020

In this project we have explored the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland. In particular, we have created a poster (with 12 plots embedded) and a presentation (18 interactive plots, 1 static plot and 1 GIF animation). When creating plots, we have used the seaborn (static plots), matplotlib (static plots), geopandas (maps), plotly (interactive plots) and imagemagick (animation).

The data came from: Kaggle, Our World in Data, Apple, Bundesamt fur Gesundheit, and SRG SSR. In some of the plots we have created the data manually based on the information from the research papers (the PDF-s are included in the data folder). The details:
